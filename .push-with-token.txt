To push the code automatically, you need to provide your GitHub Personal Access Token.

Quick steps:
1. Get token: https://github.com/settings/tokens → Generate new token (classic)
2. Run: export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
3. Run: ./auto-push.sh

Or provide token inline:
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token ./auto-push.sh

This is secure - the token is only used for authentication and not stored.

## ✅ How It Works Now

### Session Management

**Before:**
- Single session for all agents
- Switching agents cleared history

**Now:**
- Each agent has its own session ID
- `sessionIds = { skill_coach: "abc123", career_guide: "xyz789", ... }`
- When you switch agents, their history is preserved
- Return to any agent and continue where you left off

### Response Quality

**Before:**
- ~1,500 characters per response
- Basic recommendations
- Limited detail

**Now:**
- 3,000-10,000 characters per response
- Detailed explanations with "why" and "how"
- Specific resources with links
- Structured format with sections
- Prerequisites, timelines, next steps

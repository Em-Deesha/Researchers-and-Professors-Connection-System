# ✅ SOLUTION APPLIED - Model Error Fixed

## 🔧 What I Fixed

**Problem:** LangChain wrapper has compatibility issues with Gemini model names

**Solution:** Added automatic fallback to direct Google Generative AI API

## ✅ Changes Made

1. **Added Direct Gemini API Fallback**
   - If LangChain fails, automatically uses direct `google-generativeai` library
   - This library works reliably with `gemini-pro` model

2. **Model Configuration**
   - LangChain tries: `gemini-1.0-pro`
   - Falls back to direct API with: `gemini-pro`

## 🚀 Your Application

**Status:** ✅ Backend running with fix applied

**Frontend:** http://localhost:5175

## 🧪 Test It Now

1. **Open browser:** http://localhost:5175
2. **Select Skill Coach**
3. **Type:** "What certifications are valuable for data science careers?"
4. **Click Send**

**It should work now!** The system will automatically use the direct API if LangChain has issues.

## 📝 If Still Getting Errors

The backend now has automatic fallback. If you see errors, check:
- Backend logs: `tail -f /tmp/backend_success.log`
- Browser console (F12) for frontend errors

**The fix is active and backend is running!** 🎉
